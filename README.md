### Purpose

This is a static site I made to learn Svelte, then Svelte 5, and Tailwind CSS.

### Building

Clone the repo:

```bash
git clone github.com/nocdn/portfolio.git
```

Install dependencies (I prefer to use bun):

```bash
bun install
```

Build the project:

```bash
bun run build
```

Now you can serve the files generated in the `dist` folder with any static hosting server or service.
