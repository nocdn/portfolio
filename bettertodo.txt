All right, so here's what I'm going to change. On the main about page, when I hover over the main paragraph that says, my name is Bartur Bak, I've been a developer for, you know, that amount. When I hover over that, there should be a smooth little underline that like blurs in and opacity in, fade in underneath, craft nice things, which will, when I click on that, it will take me to the project section where I can see the projects or all the things I made. um the other thing is when hovering over the entire skills box like the entire element the ones that i'm most proficient at should be illuminated in the slight red like ever so slight red that is the same kind of red that is on the faded sidebar when the sidebar is faded that kind of red and then maybe next to the skills title in brackets I can put in that same red brackets like most proficient or something like that for when it's to show what the red actually means maybe at the bottom I'll remove the signature and then yeah that should be all the changes
